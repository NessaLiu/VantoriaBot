# VantoriaBot
A multi-purpose entertainment bot!
We experimented with slash commands, databases, and webscraping to deliver a series of fun functions :)

The bot features several minigames, a profile system which can allow users to add, edit and delete profiles, and a neat quote generator
to give you the best quote to match your mood! 

Another exciting project I had the opportunity to work on - designed and created with my friend! In order to study databases using MySQL, we incorporated several profile commands which all accessed a database with the stored data to create, edit, view and delete entries. To dive deeper into the many possibilities of this creative project, we used BeautifulSoup to webscrape quotes and deliver category-specific content depending on a user's reaction to a outputted command message. A simple and clear help menu describes all the commands one can use, with a "Games" section featuring 3 minigames, a "Profile" section and a "Self-care" section as well. With careful thought put into the aesthetic and added convenience with slash commands, we were proud to launch the bot after several weeks of diligent hard work! See what else Vantoria has to offer
